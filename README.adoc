> What happening?

== Intro

I am trying to retrieve data from a **`MATERIALIZED VIEW`** on a PostgreSQL Database.

But I am getting into trouble.
So, I have written a simple Python+SQLAlchemy code to demonstrate this.

=== Technologies

pypi packages::

- pip installs the latest version of SQLAlchemy (2.0.41) and Psycopg(3.2.9)
+
```bash
pip install sqlalchemy psycopg["binary"]
```

=== Database initialization

`initdb.d/``::

[source, sql]
----
-- Initialize database
0_db_init.sql

-- load sample data (15000 lines)
data_survey_0005.sql

-- Create materialezed view and its index
zz_create_views.sql
----


.`0_db_init.sql` statments
[source, sql]
----
include::initdb.d/0_db_init.sql[]
----

.`zz_create_views.sql` statments
[source, sql]
----
include::initdb.d/zz_create_views.sql[]
----


== Run demo app

App main script is `surveys.py` (for this demo db host is fixed to run the app using `docker compose`).

.initialize the database
[source, bash]
----
docker compose up -d pg-server
----

After the database is running and data loaded it is able to retrive some data.

.Get some loaded data from the database
[source, bash]
----
PGPASSWORD=notsecure psql -h localhost -U surveys \
-c "select * from analysis.mview_surveys_loaded_at_status order by loaded_at limit 30;"
----

.Sample of retrieved data
[cols="^2,^1,>2", align="center"]

== The issue

1. `sa.select(Model)`: retrieve data using the model defined at `surveys_model.py`. +
As you can see, here the `status` value repeats _N_ times within the same date and time is equal.
2. `sa.text('select ...')`: retrieve data using ad-hoc _selection text_ +
On the other hand, here the `status` value is correct.


What I need to do to fix this issue?
